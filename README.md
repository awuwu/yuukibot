About YuukiBot

Requirements
---

 * Python 2.7.x
 * python-twitter
 * python-telegram-bot
 * Virtualenv (Reccomended)
 * pip (Reccomended)
 * screen (Reccomended, Linux ONLY)

Installing
---

These instructions are assuming you are running on Debian 8 or a recent distribution of Ubuntu (Code tested on Debian 8). I highly reccomend a virtualenv with pip.

* `git clone https://github.com/awuwu/yuukibot.git`
* `virtualenv yuukibot/env`
* `cd yuukibot`
* `source env/bin/activate`
* `pip install -f requirements.txt`
* (if errors occur, fix those first. Usually C compilations. Warnings you can ignore, YuukiBot uses very little of it.)
* Copy config.example.cfg to config.cfg
* Edit config.cfg variables to your leisure.

Executing
---

(For most people)

* Run `python yuuki.py`

(If you're using screen)

* `screen -S yuukibot`
* `python yuuki.py`

Adding Content
---

Because of the nature that YuukiBot pulls information, you can add content like gifs, quotes, fortune entries, etc while the bot is operational, meaning you don't have to restart.
